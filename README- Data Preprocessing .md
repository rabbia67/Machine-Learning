# Data Preprocessing for Machine Learning 
This repository contains the code and explanation for a data preprocessing pipeline as part of a Machine Learning course assignment. The preprocessing steps help prepare raw data for training models by cleaning, transforming, and normalizing the dataset to improve model performance.
# Objectives
Load and explore the dataset.

Handle missing data.

Encode categorical features.

Normalize numerical values.

Split the dataset for training and testing.

# Preprocessing Steps
# 1. Import Libraries
Essential libraries such as pandas, numpy, sklearn, and matplotlib are used for data manipulation, preprocessing, and visualization.
